# WeatherAppDemo
Initial Revision

This is a demo weather App written in ASP.NET MVC using VS2013 Express edition. The purpose is to be able to acquire temperature and wind speed readings from a number of configured sources and then evaluate the average values to be displayed. The UI is currently in its simplistic form. Better styling will follow once the underlying code is thoroughly tested. The idea is to be able to add new weather sources - which may introduce new measurments units - and be able to update the app with minimum coding.
